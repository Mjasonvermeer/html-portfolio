<h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>Marcel</h2>
  <p>
    My life started in Randburg in 2000. I lived in South Africa for 12 years and then we moved to the Netherlands. I lived in the Netherlands until I was eighteen, I went to study in America for my Associate Degree in Computer Science at Foothill College. When I was 21, I returned to the Netherlands. I am now 23 and I am looking into whether I can resume my studies in the Netherlands.
    My favorite hobby has changed a lot in recent years, but I now really enjoy gaming and sports. At the moment I'm mainly working on Overwatch 2.
    I also play in an Overwatch team and we play three times a week, from 20:00 to 22:00. I go to the gym 3 times a week.
